# Stride Value Predictor

## Academic Project

### Stride Value Prediction (VP) for the Superscalar Simulator, Advanced Microarchitecture

- Integrated Stride VP in a trace-based out-of-order (OOO) superscalar simulator.
- Achieved a significant improvement in Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) by breaking data dependencies.
- Resulted in a 70% increase in Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) for the 473.astar_Biglakes and 473.astar_Rivers SPEC benchmark combinations.

### Rename-Dispatch-Retire for the Cycle-Accurate RISC-V Superscalar Simulator (721sim), Advanced Microarchitecture

- Implemented rename, dispatch, and retire stages for the cycle-accurate RISC-V superscalar simulator (721sim) designed by Dr. Rotenberg.
- Added parts of the simulator involving Load Queue, Store Queue, stalling instruction logic, recovery for branch misprediction, and exception handling.

This project showcases the integration of stride value prediction in a superscalar simulator and the implementation of key stages in a cycle-accurate RISC-V simulator, highlighting significant improvements in performance and accuracy in advanced microarchitecture simulations.
