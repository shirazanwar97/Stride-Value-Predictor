For first time setup-

Make sure you have created all/usefull branches locally as same as on the remote(github server).

1. git checkout <branch_name>
2. <yet to discover>


For regular use-
1. make sure to switch to branch that you want to use.
	This should be ideally collaborator branch(mpanda or skhan25)
2. Once in the desired branch, you go on and do all the changes you are trying to do.
3. once all the changes are done, go on to commit those changes by using following commands

i) git add file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
   or
   git add .
ii) git commit
iii) git push origin <collaborator_branch_name>

For merging collaborator branches changes to work branch-
1. git checkout work
2. git merge <collaborator_branch_name>
3. Resolve any Merge Conflicts (if necessary)--> console will prompt if necessary.
4. git push origin work

For merging work branches changes to main branch-
1. git checkout main
2. git merge work
3. Resolve any Merge Conflicts (if necessary)--> console will prompt if necessary.
4. git push origin main
